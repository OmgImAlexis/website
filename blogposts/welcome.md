Welcome to the new blog for the Caddy project! Since [its announcement](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9452606) in April 2015, Caddy has grown significantly with numerous pull requests from [contributors around the world](https://github.com/mholt/caddy/graphs/contributors). To help promote [the Caddy community](https://gophers.slack.com/messages/caddy) and foster project growth, we're starting this blog which will feature posts from contributors as well as guest posts from anyone who uses Caddy that has something to share.

This blog is for Caddy users and developers alike. Posts will range from less technical topics such as using Caddy more effectively to more technical ones about modern Web technologies or developing around Caddy.

We'll try to hold the content quality of this blog to a high standard. We want to make sure every article has something interesting to say. Most posts will be in English, though we encourage occasional guest posts in other languages.

Anyone who would like to write for this blog is welcome to contribute. To submit a guest post, please write it in Markdown, have someone edit it for you, then [send a pull request](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddyserver.com). Posts should be about Caddy or anything related to the Web: HTTP/2, WebSockets, optimizations, security, etc. They can be informative, informational, tastefully comical, or insighftul. They can also be stories from your own experience. Above all, posts should be interesting and correct.

If you'd like feedback before writing a post or aren't sure if it would be published, just ask!

For your information, this blog is powered entirely by Caddy, which [renders Markdown](/docs/markdown), the format in which the posts are authored. The [git addon](/docs/git) is used to deploy the site with a simple <code>git push</code>.

We hope you enjoy the blog and find it a valuable, informative resource.
