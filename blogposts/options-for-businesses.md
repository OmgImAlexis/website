For years, businesses have been interested in the Caddy project but unable to secure for themselves guarantees of continued development because of its free and open source nature. Other businesses want to promote Caddy's benefits across the Web in the best interest of their own customers. Today, I'm pleased to introduce the **Caddy Engineering Package** and **official Caddy Sponsorship** plans to help fill those voids.

This has been almost 12 months in the making. Last year, I teamed up with Cory Cooper, a computer engineer out of [my same university](https://www.byu.edu), to form [Light Code Labs, LLC](https://www.lightcodelabs.com), which is the steward company over the Caddy project. We talked to dozens of companies about Caddy and their needs. And now, we couldn't be more excited to debut Light Code Labs at a time when Web technologies are flourishing and the potential for Caddy's growth is as high as ever.

We believe that continuing Caddy's development is in everyone's&mdash;indeed, the whole Internet's&mdash;best interest. Caddy plays a leading role in making modern privacy and security technologies accessible to site owners in ways that were never possible before. For instance, it was the first web server to implement [automatic HTTPS](/docs/automatic-https) and proved that secure connections _can_ "just work". Since then, countless other libraries, applications, and commercial services have followed suit and done similar. It became clear that Caddy is more than just another web server. Its influence has already rippled across the Internet.

The server-client architecture of the Web means that Caddy need only serve a few websites in order to reach millions of clients and secure billions of connections. Caddy is uniquely positioned to make the Web better for _a lot_ of people, including your own company and its customers.

With this in mind, we designed both products to focus on bringing you and everyone the best possible results of Caddy's development. The [pricing](/pricing) is easy to understand: no licensing fees, no instance limits. There's simply a monthly and yearly plan; and subscribing yearly gives you one or two months free.


## Sponsorship

[Sponsorships](/pricing#sponsorship) promote your brand while keeping Caddy free for everyone to use. We'll add your logo and link to every page of this site, mention your name and awesomeness on social media and in release announcements, and give you access to an [exclusive Slack channel](https://caddyserver.slack.com).

With a sponsorship, you play an important role in bringing secure and private connections to millions of people who use the Internet. You also help make reliable web development quicker and easier for yourself and developers that you associate with or who buy your products/services. Each sponsorship helps grow the Caddy ecosystem and community in ways that are not possible otherwise.

Sponsorships are just [$500/mo. or $5000/yr.](/pricing)


## Engineering Package

The [Engineering Package](/pricing#engineering-package) finances high-quality Caddy development from the authors, with a special emphasis on your bug reports and feature requests. You'll also get access to private technical support, something offered only to Engineering Package subscribers; and of course, an invite to our [exclusive Slack community](https://caddyserver.slack.com) with other subscribers and sponsors.

This product is designed for businesses that use Caddy, or for businesses whose customers rely on Caddy and where the business wants special access to the Caddy developers in the interest of their customers. A subscription ensures you and your customers can use this open source software with confidence. While your subscription is active, development by the authors is guaranteed to continue.

Subscribers may email or direct message us for technical support instead of being required to post (potentially sensitive) details in a public venue. Your bug reports receive priority, and we give extended consideration to your feature requests. Caddy is still available under the same open source license to subscribers, meaning if you use it in your work or product you must retain the copyright and state all changes. But subscribers can request to purchase a commercial license by contacting us.

Engineering Package subscriptions are just [$900/mo. or $9900/yr.](/pricing) no matter how many Caddy instances you run.


## Caddy is Open Source

It is not easy to make open source sustainable. We chose this path after careful consideration of many different ways to do it. Several people suggested switching to a GPL or commercial license. But we knew that would almost inevitably end up with someone forking the project at the last commit under Apache 2.0, fragmenting the project and its community.

Others recommended splitting Caddy's feature set in two and offering a paid "Caddy Pro" edition. But this wasn't appealing to us, since Caddy's most valuable features are also its core values: privacy and usability. And dividing development between a free version and a paid version creates a conflict of interest in maintaining both versions equally; surely the paid version would suffocate development time from the free one. Even if that worked out, it still would split our loyalties in half: one face of our small company would be open source, another would be enterprise. Doing both sounded exhausting.

We even got approached for the project to be acquired.

But Caddy is still open source. Its license and ownership isn't changing. To those of you who contribute to Caddy code or its community: continue to do so! Involvement from the community is still vital; it's the life blood of the project.

We'll continue to tweak our product offering over time. But we're confident, after consulting with many different individuals and organizations, that these options for businesses will help make Caddy sustainable in the long run and provide much-wanted value to businesses looking to use Caddy to streamline their operations and reduce their costs and make life easier for developers.
