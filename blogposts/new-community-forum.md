If you've been with the Caddy community for some amount of time now, you'll know that we went from only GitHub issues, expanding to a channel in [Gophers Slack](https://gophers.slack.com), then to Gitter. The number of site owners adopting Caddy has been growing fast, as has been the number of questions, so today I'm relieved to present a new, self-hosted [home for the Caddy community](https://forum.caddyserver.com).

The [Caddy community forum](https://forum.caddyserver.com) is for all discussion that doesn't belong in GitHub issues or pull requests. GitHub is where specific, development-related discussion occurs: bug reports, new features, code reviews, etc. Everything else can go in the forum.

I hope you'll participate with us!

## Why move everyone again

I must apologize to you all for moving us a third time. Each of the venues worked well in some ways and fell short in others.

We want GitHub issues to be mainly for tracking development. It doesn't scale well to many different types of conversations. We will continue to use GitHub issues and pull requests, of course, but those will be focused more specifically on improving and progressing Caddy as a software project.

At the time, the Slack channel had a high barrier to entry; signup was invite-only. Besides that, users who were not Go programmers may not have been inclined to join a Go programming Slack.

We moved to Gitter in an effort to help more users participate. Its integration with GitHub was nice. We made a room for development, another for support, and another for everything else. But it seemed that only one room was used for... everything.

The biggest problem with Slack and Gitter was that context is so easily lost and content is not easily searchable. Too much value has been sequestered in forgotten chats. Future users came along and asked the same questions over and over with no way to find previous answers. A forum preserves answers for future readers.


## Closing the Gitter channels

The three Gitter rooms we used for chat are being closed. Our forum is powered by Discourse, which updates posts in real-time, so messages still feel "chatty" when desired, but posts are more comprehensive. Most importantly, posts are there to stay. They are indexed by search engines, meaning that future readers with the same question won't have to ask it again.

This means that, except for GitHub, the forum will be the only official Caddy venue. (There is still [@caddyserver](https://twitter.com/caddyserver) on Twitter, but that's a little different.)


## Possible because of you

Thank you *very much* for your donations! They are going toward hosting and maintaining our own Discourse installation, along with storage for all the assets accrued from the community over time. These are recurring costs, and your continued support makes it possible for the community to have a high-quality place to collect its knowledge and experience. *Thank you!*
