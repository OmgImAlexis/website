	<p>
		This page will help you release an updated version of your plugin. You can release at any point that you can "git checkout": branches, tags, and commits.
	</p>
	<p>
		To release a tag, make sure your tag has already been created and pushed. To release a commit, ensure the commit is pushed, then paste the full SHA.
	</p>
	<p>
		If releasing at a branch name, your plugin will be deployed now as it currently is on the given branch. There are two ways to deploy a branch. 1) Prefix with "origin/" will cause the latest commits on that branch to be pulled in when your plugin <i>or another that depends on it</i> is deployed again. 2) If you specify only the branch name (without the "origin/" prefix), this causes git to checkout only the local branch sans remote changes. (We don't do a separate git pull.) <b>It's always recommended to release a tag or commit instead.</b>
