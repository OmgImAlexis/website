					<h3>Caddy saves businesses time and money</h3>
					<p>
						Companies love using Caddy because it's so easy to configure and takes care of regular TLS maintenance for you, including obtaining, installing, and renewing certificates. Some companies are saving tens of thousands of dollars per year with Caddy.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box-33">
					<h3>Caddy makes sites more reliable and secure</h3>
					<p>
						Caddy is the web server of choice for many companies because its default TLS configuration is PCI-compliant, its core is easily extended with plugins written in Go, and so little time needs to be spent managing it. This reduces error surface, making your site more reliable and secure.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box-33">
					<h3>Caddy at the heart of your business</h3>
					<p>
						Your website is vital to your company: give it the best treatment available with the Caddy Engineering Package. Your bug reports and feature requests get addressed before other open source issues, and you get private support so Caddy runs your company's site smoothly.

					<h3>Unlimited instances</h3>

			<h2>FAQ</h2>
			<div class="boxes">
				<div class="box-50">
					<h3>Are payments refundable?</h3>
					<p>
						Yes, prorated refunds are available upon request.
					</p>

					<h3>How do I get private support?</h3>
					<p>
						Engineering Package subscribers may contact us via email, reach out in our <a href="https://caddyserver.slack.com">exclusive Slack community</a>, or direct message us in the <a href="https://forum.caddyserver.com">Caddy Forum</a> for private support. This information, including our support email, is sent to you when you sign up!
					</p>

					<h3>What happens after I pay?</h3>
					<p>
						You'll get an automated email that you can reply to. It has instructions for how you can use your product.
					</p>

					<h3>What if I need enterprise-scale support?</h3>
					<p>
						The Engineering Package is sufficient for most customers, but feel free to <a href="mailto:sales@lightcodelabs.com">email us</a> if you need support at a large scale or custom/proprietary development work. If we can't do it, we probably know someone who can.
					</p>

					<h3>How does invoicing work?</h3>
					<p>
						For annual subscriptions, we can send you an invoice which you may pay with credit/debit card or ACH transfer. We can also discuss other payment methods if absolutely needed; please talk to us about your requirements!
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box-50">
					<h3>Can I purchase both?</h3>
					<p>
						Yes! You can be a sponsor and subscribe to the Engineering Package at the same time. Simply purchase both on this page, or <a href="mailto:sales@lightcodelabs.com">contact us</a> and we'll set you up in a jiffy.
					</p>

					<h3>How many support hours do I get?</h3>
					<p>
						Engineering Package subscribers are entitled to support from the authors. We don't count hours because it's tedious and makes billing complicated. We know you don't like being tied up in troubleshooting (we don't either!) so we'll do our best to get it resolved as quickly as possible. If your support needs go beyond what our team can offer, we'll let you know and we can discuss enterprise options.
					</p>

					<h3>This is an open source project. With whom am I doing business?</h3>
					<p>
						You'll do business with <a href="https://www.lightcodelabs.com">Light Code Labs, LLC</a>, the steward company of the Caddy project.
					</p>

					<h3>Are these payments recurring?</h3>
					<p>
						Yes; Caddy is an ongoing project, and your web server is constantly running. It requires continuous effort to maintain that for you and everyone. When you purchase, you will be billed monthly or annually. You can cancel your subscription at any time.
