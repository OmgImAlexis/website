					<h3>Caddy saves businesses time and money</h3>
					<p>
						Businesses love using Caddy because it's easy to configure and takes care of regular TLS maintenance for them, including obtaining, installing, and renewing certificates. Some companies are saving tens of thousands of dollars per year with Caddy because of this alone.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box-33">
					<h3>Caddy makes sites more reliable and secure</h3>
					<p>
						Caddy is the web server of choice for many businesses because its default TLS configuration is PCI-compliant, its core is easily extended with plugins written in Go, and so little time needs to be spent managing it. This reduces error surface, making your site more reliable and secure.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box-33">
					<h3>Caddy at the heart of your business</h3>
					<p>
						Your website is vital to your company: give it the best treatment available with the Caddy Engineering Package. Your bug reports and feature requests get addressed before other open source issues, and you get private support with using Caddy.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="boxes">
				<div class="box-33">
					<h3>Focused on development</h3>
					<p>
						The Engineering Package is primarily for financing focused development by the authors. If the highest-quality code is important to your business, subscribe to ensure you receive the best open source development available for your site.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box-33">
					<h3>Unlimited instances</h3>
					<p>
						While other production-grade web servers charge thousands of dollars per instance, the Engineering Package covers all your Caddy instances for one flat rate.

			<h2>FAQ</h2>
			<div class="boxes">
				<div class="box-50">
					<h3>Can I purchase both?</h3>
					<p>
						Yes! You can be a sponsor and subscribe to the Engineering Package at the same time. Simply purchase both on this page, or <a href="mailto:sales@lightcodelabs.com">contact us</a> and we'll set you up in a jiffy.
					</p>

					<h3>How do I get private support?</h3>
					<p>
						Engineering Package subscribers may contact us via email, reach out in our <a href="https://caddyserver.slack.com">exclusive Slack community</a>, or direct message us in the <a href="https://caddy.community">Caddy Forum</a> for private support. This information, including our support email, is sent to you when you sign up!
					</p>

					<h3>What happens after I pay?</h3>
					<p>
						You'll get an automated email that you can reply to. It has instructions for how you can use your product. We look forward to getting to know your needs and interests!
					</p>

					<h3>What if I need enterprise-scale support?</h3>
					<p>
						The Engineering Package is sufficient for most customers, but feel free to <a href="mailto:sales@lightcodelabs.com">email us</a> about enterprise-class support; we can discuss your needs and options.
					</p>

					<h3>How does invoicing work?</h3>
					<p>
						For annual subscriptions, we can send you an invoice which you may pay with credit/debit card or ACH transfer. We can also discuss other payment methods if absolutely needed; please talk to us about your requirements!
					</p>

					<h3>Will you write a custom plugin for me?</h3>
					<p>
						Our primary focus is on developing Caddy, so custom plugins and coding work is not included with the Engineering Package. However, we're always happy to discuss your needs! Contact us and tell us your requirements; we might be able to help you or suggest someone who can.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box-50">
					<h3>Are payments refundable?</h3>
					<p>
						Yes, prorated refunds are available upon request.
					</p>

					<h3>Do I get a commercial license?</h3>
					<p>
						No, the same open source license applies to businesses, meaning: <b>if you use Caddy in your work or product, you must give attribution and state all changes.</b> However, please <a href="mailto:sales@lightcodelabs.com">email us</a> if you would like to purchase a commercial license!
					</p>

					<h3>How many support hours do I get?</h3>
					<p>
						Engineering Package subscribers are entitled to support for Caddy from its authors. We don't count hours because it's tedious and makes billing complicated. We know you don't like being tied up in troubleshooting, so we'll do our best to get it resolved as quickly as possible!
					</p>

					<h3>This is an open source project. With whom am I doing business?</h3>
					<p>
						You'll do business with <a href="https://www.lightcodelabs.com">Light Code Labs, LLC</a>, the steward company of the Caddy project.
					</p>

					<h3>Are these payments recurring?</h3>
					<p>
						Yes; Caddy is an ongoing project, and your web server is constantly running. It requires continuous effort to maintain the project because the Web doesn't stay still! When you purchase, you will be billed monthly or annually. You can cancel your subscription at any time.
					</p>

					<h3>What exactly can you give support for?</h3>
					<p>
						We're the Caddy experts, and our Engineering Package covers development of and consultation for Caddy specifically. Remember, you'll also have access to a community of other Caddy users that have various areas of expertise.
