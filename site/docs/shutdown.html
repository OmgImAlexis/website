                <h2>shutdown</h2>

                <p>shutdown executes a command when the server exits. This is useful for performing cleanup or stopping a background
                    process like php-fpm. (Also see <a href="/docs/startup">startup</a>.)</p>

                <p>Each command that is executed at shutdown is blocking. The output and error of the command go to stdout and
                    stderr, respectively. There is no stdin.</p>

                <p>Note that shutdown commands will not execute if Caddy is force-terminated, for example, by using a &quot;Force
                    Quit&quot; feature provided by your operating system. However, a typical SIGINT (Ctrl+C) will allow the
                    shutdown commands to execute.</p>

                <p>Even if this directive is shared by more than one host, the command will only execute once.</p>
