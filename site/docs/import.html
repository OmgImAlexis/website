                <p>import allows you to use configuration from another file. It gets replaced with the contents of that file.</p>

                <p>This is a unique directive in that <code>import</code> can appear outside of a server block. In other words,
                    it can appear at the top of a Caddyfile where an address would normally be. Like other directives, however,
                    it cannot be used inside of other directives.</p>

                <p>Note that the the import path is relative to the Caddyfile, not the current working directory.</p>

                <h3 id="syntax">Syntax</h3>

                <p><code class="block"><span class="cf-dir">import</span> <span class="cf-arg"><i>pattern</i></span></code></p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>pattern</strong> is the file or glob pattern (<code>*</code>) to include. Its contents will replace
                        this line, as if that file's contents appeared here to begin with. This value is relative to the
                        file's location. It is an error if a specific file cannot be found, but an empty glob pattern is
                        not an error.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

                <p>Import a shared configuration:</p>

                <p><code class="block"><span class="cf-dir">import</span> <span class="cf-arg">config/common.conf</span></code></p>

                <p>Imports any files found in the vhosts folder:</p>

                <p><code class="block"><span class="cf-dir">import</span> <span class="cf-arg">../vhosts/*</span></code></p>
