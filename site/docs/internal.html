				<h2>http.internal</h2>

				<p>internal protects all resources in the specified directory from external requests. Browsers (or any client) that directly
					requests a resource in the protected directory will receive a 404 Not Found status.</p>

				<p>Because this directive supports the X-Accel-Redirect header, it is often used in conjunction with a backend proxy. Requests
					to a different URL than the internal one may be redirected to a proxy, which can set the X-Accel-Redirect header. When
					Caddy sees this coming from the proxy, it will allow access to the internal resource and send it to the client. This
					is also known sometimes as X-Sendfile.</p>

				<p>This pattern handling requests allows a backend proxy to perform logging, authentication, and other things without the
					client having to deal with redirects.</p>

				<h3 id="syntax">Syntax</h3>

				<p><code class="block"><span class="cf-dir">internal</span> <span class="cf-arg"><i>path</i></span></code></p>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>path</strong> is the base path to protect from external requests</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

				<p>To protect all contents of /internal from being served directly:</p>

				<p><code class="block"><span class="cf-dir">internal</span> <span class="cf-arg">/internal</span></code></p>

				<p>Part of an example Caddyfile that protects some resources but allows a proxy to grant access to them (the service listening
					on :9000 must set X-Accel-Redirect):</p>

				<p><code class="block"><span class="cf-dir">internal</span> <span class="cf-arg">/internal</span>
<span class="cf-dir">proxy</span>    <span class="cf-arg">/redirect http://localhost:9000</span></code></p>
