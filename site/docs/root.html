				<h2>http.root</h2>

				<p>root simply specifies the root of the site. This is very useful, in fact required, if the root (/) directory of the website is not the same as where Caddy is being executed from.</p>

				<p>The default root is the current working directory. A relative root path is relative to the current working directory.</p>

				<h3 id="syntax">Syntax</h3>

				<p><code class="block"><span class="cf-dir">root</span> <span class="cf-arg"><i>path</i></span></code></p>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>path</strong> is the directory to set as the site root</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

				<p>Serve the website out of Jake's public_html folder instead of the current working directory:</p>

				<p><code class="block"><span class="cf-dir">root</span> <span class="cf-arg">/home/jake/public_html</span></code></p>
