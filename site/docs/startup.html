				<h2>startup</h2>

				<p>
					startup executes a command when the server begins. This is useful for preparing to serve a site by running a script or starting a background process like php-fpm. (Also see <a href="/docs/shutdown">shutdown</a>.)
				</p>

				<p>
					Each command that is executed at startup is blocking, unless you suffix the command with a space and <code>&amp;</code>, which will cause the command to be run in the background. The output and error of the command go to stdout and stderr, respectively. There is no stdin.
				</p>

				<p>
					A command will only be executed once for each time it appears in the Caddyfile.
				</p>

				<h3 id="syntax">Syntax</h3>

				<p><code class="block"><span class="cf-dir">startup</span> <span class="cf-arg"><i>command</i></span></code></p>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>command</strong> is the command to execute; it may be followed by arguments</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

				<p>Start php-fpm before the server starts listening:</p>

				<p><code class="block"><span class="cf-dir">startup</span> <span class="cf-arg">/etc/init.d/php-fpm start</span></code></p>

				<p>On windows, you might need to use quotes when the command path contains spaces:</p>

				<p><code class="block"><span class="cf-dir">startup</span> <span class="cf-arg">&quot;\&quot;C:\Program Files\PHP\v7.0\php-cgi.exe\&quot; -b 127.0.0.1:9123&quot; &amp;</span></code></p>
