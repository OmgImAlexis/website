                <p>ext allows your site to have clean URLs by assuming a file extension when the path of the URL does not end
                    with one.</p>

                <p>An extension in the URL is detected by checking the last element of the path for a dot (<code>.</code>).</p>

                <h3 id="syntax">Syntax</h3>

                <p><code class="block"><span class="cf-dir">ext</span> <span class="cf-arg"><i>extensions...</i></span></code></p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>extensions...</strong> is a list of space-separated extensions (including the dot) to try. Extensions
                        will be tried in the order listed. At least one extension is required.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

                <p>Suppose you have a file called /contact.html. You could serve that file at /contact by having Caddy try .html
                    files.
                </p>

                <p>To try .html, .htm, and .php in order:</p>

                <p><code class="block"><span class="cf-dir">ext</span> <span class="cf-arg">.html .htm .php</span></code></p>
