	<p>
		This page will help you release an updated version of your plugin. You can release at any point that you can "git checkout": branches, tags, and commits.
	</p>
	<p>
		To release a tag, make sure your tag has already been created and pushed. To release a commit, ensure the commit is pushed, then paste the full SHA.
	</p>
	<p>
		If releasing at a branch name, your plugin will be deployed now as it currently is on the given branch. However, if your plugin's package is a dependency of any other plugin, it's possible that it will be updated to the latest on the branch without warning. In other words, deploying from a branch name may not stay at the same commit as it is right now. It's always recommended to release a tag or commit instead.
