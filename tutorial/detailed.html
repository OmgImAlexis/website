					This tutorial will help you install, run, and configure Caddy for your first time. (If you've used web servers before, skip to the <a href="#quick-start">Quick Start</a>.) Although Caddy is very easy to use, it is still expected that you are already familiar with using your machine:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Extracting, moving, and renaming files</li>
					<li>Managing users and file permissions</li>
					<li>Using the terminal or command line</li>
					<li>Configuring your firewall</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					With these prerequisites, this tutorial should be valid for all OS platforms. Some instructions may be OS-specific.
				</p>

				</ol>
				<p>
					Caddy's default port is 2015, so open your browser to <a href="http://localhost:2015">http://localhost:2015</a> to see it working. If you see a 404 error, then Caddy is working, but the root of your site is missing an index file.
				</p>
				<p>
					Congratulations! You're up and running. Skip to the <a href="#configure">Configure</a> section of the tutorial to do more.
				</p>

				<h2 id="download">Download</h2>
				<p>
					Download Caddy from <a href="/download">the download page</a>. You can get Caddy for nearly any OS and architecture, optionally configured with plugins for extra functionality.
				</p>
				<p>
					You could also download <a href="https://github.com/mholt/caddy/releases/latest">the latest release</a> from GitHub (without plugins).
				</p>

				<h2 id="install">Install</h2>
				<p>
					The file you downloaded is a compressed archive. You'll want to extract the Caddy binary (executable file).
				</p>
				<div class="note">
					<div class="title">Windows</div>
					Right-click the .zip file and choose "Extract All". Choose any folder to extract into, just don't lose track of it. You can delete it when we're done.
				</div>
				<div class="note">
					<div class="title">macOS</div>
					Double-click the .zip file to extract it, or run this command:
					<code class="block cmd bash">unzip caddy*.zip caddy</code>
				</div>
				<div class="note">
					<div class="title">Linux</div>
					Run this command:
					<code class="block cmd bash">tar -xzf caddy*.tar.gz caddy</code>
				</div>
				<p>
					Next, we will move the Caddy binary into a folder where we can execute it easily.
				</p>
				<div class="note">
					<div class="title">Windows</div>
					Move the executable to any folder that's easy to get at. For example, <code>C:\Caddy</code>.
				</div>
				<div class="note">
					<div class="title">macOS and Linux</div>
					Any $PATH location will do:
					<code class="block cmd bash">mv ./caddy /usr/local/bin</code>
					If you get permission denied errors, you'll need to run as sudo.
				</div>
				<p>
					Now Caddy is at our fingertips. Let's run it!
				</p>

				<h2 id="run">Run</h2>
				<p>
					By default, Caddy will use the current directory (the directory it is being executed from, <i>not</i> the folder where the binary lives) as the root of the site.
				</p>
				<p>
					Using the terminal or command line, change into the folder where your site is:
				</p>
				<code class="block cmd">cd path/to/my/site</code>
				<p>
					And run Caddy:
				</p>
				<div class="note">
					<div class="title">Windows</div>
					Assuming you put the .exe file in C:\Caddy:
					<code class="block cmd">C:\Caddy\caddy.exe</code>
				</div>
				<div class="note">
					<div class="title">macOS and Linux</div>
					<code class="block cmd bash">caddy</code>
				</div>
				<p>
					Load <a href="http://localhost:2015">http://localhost:2015</a> in your browser. If you see a 404 error, then Caddy is working but your site is missing an index file.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can quit Caddy by pressing Ctrl+C. It will terminate as gracefully as possible.
				</p>
				
				<h2 id="configure">Configure</h2>
				<p>
					Your site is already fit for production, except it's on port 2015, not 80 (the standard HTTP port). Operating systems don't let programs bind to low ports like 80 without root privileges. This tutorial doesn't go into managing permissions, but we'll show you how to change the port and assume you'll take care of the permissions safely.
				</p>
				<p>

				</p>
				<p>
					For quick, temporary servers on your local machine, you can use the <code>-port</code> command line option:
				</p>
				<div class="note">
					<div class="title">Windows</div>
					<code class="block cmd">C:\Caddy\caddy.exe -port 8080</code>
				</div>
				<div class="note">
					<div class="title">macOS and Linux</div>
					<code class="block cmd bash">caddy -port 8080</code>
				</div>
